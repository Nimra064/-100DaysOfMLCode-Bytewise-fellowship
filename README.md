# 100DaysOfMLCode
As I'm getting started with ML and DS. I will start coding python for 100 days from the very basic of it.<br>
Day-1: Installation and setup the Python Environment.<br>
Day-2: Variables and Data-Types in python. Both Primitive and Non-Primitive.<br>
Day-3: Operator, Operands Expressions and Input in Python.<br>
Day-4: Control Flow, Lists and Sets.<br>
Day-5: Strings and Common Data Structures in Python.<br>
Day-6: Looping in Python. For and While Loop.<br>
Day-7: Functions in Python. User Defined and Built-in.<br>
Day-8  Completed the Concept of Advanced Python Concept Object Oriented Programming. <br>
Day-9  Learning seaborn and Matplotlib Libraries of Python.And take Practice on <b>Corona-Virus-2023</b> dataset, Project Link here :https://github.com/Nimra064/Corona-Virus-2023-Data-Analysis- <br>
